3-4 distinct network paths 
from a source to a destination 
(different highways)

rules of congestion: 
what happens when a path gets too crowded
--> each path has a fixed capacity
--> if the load exceeds the capacity
    agents experience packet loss

50 agents
all send data at the same time
each agent has internal speed
(congestion window cwnd)



variables:
- paths 
- congestion 
- bandwidth
- size/number of packets 
- congestion
- feedback


- clock time 
- invoke event routine

path a : capacity: 
path b : capacity: 
path c : capacity: 
path d : capacity: 


agent (1 - 50) : load 
(agents choose paths to send their data; cooperative, selfish, rule-following)

if load > capacity => loss

knobs r / m 

responsiveness (m) : how likely agents are to switch paths 
                    probability that agent will switch to a different path
                    (scale 0 to 1:
                    high - close to 1: very jumpy
                    low - close to 1: 
                    might switch but probably not
                    )


reset softness (r): congestion window cwnd gets reset depending on r
                    (scale 0 to 1
                    r = 0 - hard reset: agent starts over at 
                        a slow speed on the new path)
                    r = 1 - soft reset: agent keeps all of its speed
                        when switching 


cwnd: congestion window number that represents how many packets each 
        agent is allowed to send at once, changes dynamically
        based on feedback (packet loss or no loss)

        if packet_loss:
            cwnd *= 0.5      #cwnd multiplicative decrease 
        else:
            cwnd += 1       #additive increase
