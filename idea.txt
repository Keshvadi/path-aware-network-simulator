3-4 distinct network paths 
from a source to a destination 
(different highways)

rules of congestion: 
what happens when a path gets too crowded
--> each path has a fixed capacity
--> if the load exceeds the capacity
    agents experience packet loss

50 agents
all send data at the same time
each agent has internal speed
(congestion window cwnd)




variables:
- paths 
- congestion 
- bandwidth
- size/number of packets 
- congestion
- feedback


- clock time 
- invoke event routine 

--------------------------------------------------

path a : capacity: 
path b : capacity: 
path c : capacity: 
path d : capacity: 


agent (1 - 50) : load 


if load > capacity => loss
